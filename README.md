Milestone Project-1
Website for a Restaurant
For my first milestone project I have chosen to create a website for a restaurant. This Website has four pages for users to navigate their way through everything that the restaurant has to offer. There is a navigation menu at the top of each page with links to each of the pages, Home, Food, Gallery and Contact Us. On the home screen page in the middle of the page there are two navigation links to encourage users to search through the page. The two pages I chose as the main interest was, the restaurants menu and the gallery. This allows users to view the menu and what the dishes look like. Client’s, however, could choose to emphasise another part of their website such as contact information which can be easily changed.
UX
For my first milestone project I wanted to create a website for a restaurant that was easy for users to navigate through. The web page that I have created has a simple but effective layout which has been proven to be more successful as users are more likely to fully appreciate every element without it being too difficult to find what they initially went on to find.

Restaurant owners want their businesses promoted well and websites are a great way of doing this. Having a gallery of dishes that the restaurant provides it allows subliminal marketing as it encourages the user to order the meal through subtle effects.

User Stories
As a user, I want to know how to contact the restaurant to order or reserve table.
As a user, I want to see images of the meals this restaurant provides.
As a user, I want to see a menu for a restaurant before I reserve a table.
As a user, I want to view a restaurants social media platforms easily.
As a user with dietary requirements, I want to know if there are any meals on a restaurants menu that meet my needs.
As a restaurant owner, I want to have a website that has my menu on it to easily navigate customers to when asked over the phone.
As a restaurant owner, I want to have somewhere that I can keep a gallery of photos to showcase our menu.
Design Process
Before I started coding my first milestone project I came up with a design on Balsamiq to help envision what the final product would look like.

Features
Home
The home page has a simple style. There’s an image of the inside of the restaurant which catches the users eye. There are two link buttons which when clicked takes the user to either the Menu Page or the Gallery Page depending on which they click on. The restaurant's telephone number and address are on the home page for users that are visiting purely for them details.

Menu Page
The menu page has four sections for different items on the menu. This can be easily adjusted to keep the website up-to-date with the restaurant’s menu.

Gallery Page
The gallery page was created to help users visualise the products they will receive if ordering with this particular restaurant. It displays a variety of food which subliminally markets the business with subtle efforts.

Contact Us Page
The contact us page has an email address and telephone number for the user to copy down. The business address has been linked to google maps for users to receive directions on how to get to the restaurant. The opening hours are also on this page and like the other three previous pages, the restaurant's social media accounts are linked below as well.

Features Left to Impliment
Screen Display needs adjusted to suit all devices
Adding on a delivery service page for when the restaurant decide to provide this service to users
Add page for users to order and pay for meals through the website
Link the telephone number so users can click the number on the screen and call instantly- making the service more effortless for users
Adding more to the menu section- adding it in a clearer format
Improve the graphic design element to the website for example, adding videos to the web page
Technologies Used
I used CSS and HTML5 to create this website. Bootstrap was useful throughout the process of creating this four paged website as it gave new insight as to how it could be coded. I used search engines such as Google to help source how to code different elements of the project. FreeCodeCamp helped with finding codes to use to control the footer at the bottom of the page.

I used Color-Hex throughout the project for color inspirations and codes.

Testing
I used HTML and CSS validators to test the coding aspect of my project. As for the visual aspect of the project I tested it through opening it on a web page browser and clicking on all the links in the navigation menu and reading through each section. I got my family involved in trying it out. My father is the owner of Barboni's Omagh so he was able to look through the website and confirm that each element of the website was good.

Deployment
I used Gitpod to code the web page and then pushed it to Github. I used the preview on Gitpod to see the design during the process of coding. Once finished coding I tested the web page by opening the web page on a new browser.

Credits
Where I got my content from
I got the content from a takeaway menu provided by Barboni's. I looked up their opening hours

Media
I got the photos in the website from barboni's facebook page which my mother had taken for them.
