# Milestone Project-1
<h2>Website for a Restaurant</h2>
For my first milestone project I have chosen to create a website for a restaurant.  My website has four pages, a home page, about us page, menu page and a gallery page. There is a navigation bar on the top left hand side of each of the pages for users to navigate through the website easily.  I also have two social media links on the right hand side which open on a new page to the restaurants Instagram and Facebook pages. 

<h2>UX</h2>
<p>For my first milestone project I wanted to create a website for a restaurant that was easy for users to navigate through.  The web page that I have created has a simple but effective layout which has been proven to be more successful as users are more likely to fully appreciate every element without it being too difficult to find what they initially went on to find. </p>
<p>Restaurant owners want their businesses promoted well and websites are a great way of doing this.  Having a gallery full of different dishes that the restaurant has created is a great subliminal marketing tool as it encourages the user to order the meal through subtle effects.
</p>
<h3><em>User Stories</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>As a user, I want to know how to contact the restaurant to order or reserve table or order a meal. I would want the contact information ie the telephone easily found.</li>
<li>As a user, I want to see images of the meals this restaurant provides before deciding to eat there or order for takeout.</li>
<li>As a user, I want to see a menu for a restaurant before I reserve a table or call to order for takeout.</li>
<li>As a user, I want to view a restaurants social media platforms easily.</li>
<li>As a user with dietary requirements, I want to know if there are any meals on a restaurants menu that I can't eat.</li>
<li>As a restaurant owner, I want to have somewhere that I can keep a gallery of photos to showcase our menu.</li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Design Process</em></h3>
<p>Before I started coding my first milestone project I came up with a design and drew it on some paper to help envision what the final product would look like.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h4>Home</h4>
<p>For the home page I kept it simple.  I only wanted to provide the important information to users such as, the logo, the name of the restaurant, opening hours, telephone number and address.  I included some information about the current COVID-19 restrictions which have lead to the restaurants operating as a takeaway and delivery only. The home page like all pages has a navigation bar at the top of the page which include links to the rest of the pages on the website and links to the restaurants social media, Instagram and Facebook.</p>

<h4>About Us</h4>
<p>The about us page was designed to allow the customers to connect with the brand.  It gives a description of the type of food Barboni's sell and how they operate as a business. The page like the other three has a clear navigation bar at the top of the page to allow the customer to easily navigate their way through the page.  On the footer of the page there is a link that takes the customer to google maps giving customers directions on how to locate the restaurant.</p>

<h4>Menu</h4>
<p>The main reason for the website is to have somewhere the restaurant can refer customers to when they request an online menu with descriptions of the food they produce.  The menu is easily navigated through with clear titles for each section; Starters, Mains, Side Orders, Desserts and Drinks.  There's an image displayed at the top of the page to give customers a sneak peak of the quality of food before visiting the gallery if they haven't already done so.</p>

<h4>Gallery</h4>
<p>Having a gallery is a great way to show customers the high quality of food provided by the restaurant and allows the user to see what they're ordering.  The gallery has a number of images all taken by their photographer.  Having professional images on the website are always a plus as they make the site lookmore professional.</p>

<h3>Features Left to Impliment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create an online ordering system so customers don't have to ring in their orders.</li>
<li>Create an online table reservation section on the website so customers can reserve a table on the page.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>I used CSS and HTML5 to create this website. Bootstrap was useful throughout the process of creating my first milestone project as it gave new insight as to how it could be coded.  I used search engines such as Google to help source how to code different elements of the project and looked up other restaurants websites to see how they layed out their pages and then inspected them to find out more about the codes they used.</p>  
<p>I used <a class="active" href="https://www.color-hex.com/" target="_blank">Color-Hex</a> throughout the project for the hex color code.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>I used HTML and CSS validators to test the coding aspect of my project and they passed for both.  As for the visual aspect of the project I tested it through opening it on a web page browser and clicking on all the links in the navigation menu and reading through each section. I clicked through all the links on the navigation bar to ensure there were no broken links and that external links opened on a new tab. I used the call button to make sure the button rang the restaurant, which it did. The links on the footer page were tested on all pages as well to make sure it opened on a new page on Barboni's google maps location.</p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>I used Gitpod to code the web page and then pushed it to Github. I used clear, descriptive and short commit messages throughout the project to show clearly each step of the project. I used the preview on Gitpod and open browser to see the design during the process of coding. Once finished coding I tested the web page by opening the web page on a browser to make sure all changes were saved and working properly.</p>

<h2>External Dependencies</h2>
<p>I used google fonts throughout the project for the font family.</p>


<h2>Credits</h2>
<h3>Where I got my <em>content</em> from</h3> 
<p>I got the menu content from a takeaway menu provided by Barboni's.  The images are all on their Facebook page and are open to the public. I got their telephone number and address from their social media and google information.</p>
